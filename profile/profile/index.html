<p><strong>Huygens Lyceum Eindhoven | <em>Natuur en Techniek</em></strong> <em>2012-2018</em><br>
Completed the final exam Atheneum in the program Nature &amp; Technology
with favorable consequence. Graduated in the <em>Dutch</em>, <em>English</em> and
<em>French Language and Literature</em>, <em>Mathematics (B &amp; D)</em>, <em>Physics</em>,
<em>Chemistry</em> and <em>Management and Organization (MO)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Eindhoven University Of Technology | <em>BSc Mechanical Engineering</em></strong>
<em>2018-2021</em><br>
Completed the propaedeutic phase in the first academic year (2018-2019).
Obtained Bachelors degree <em>with great appreciation</em>, average grade of
7.6/10. Bachelors End Project done in the <em>Dynamics and Control</em> group, see
<em>Projects</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Eindhoven University Of Technology | <em>MSc Mechanical Engineering at
the Dynamics and Control Group (Special track MSE)</em></strong> <em>2021-present</em><br>
The master MSE-W (Manufacturing Systems Engineering in Mechanical Engineering)
is a special track within the Master Mechanical Engineering that allows to
follow a few courses about manufacturing related topics for people with a keen
interest in manufacturing. Here I choose to focus on the modeling of
Manufacturing Networks (Queuing Theory/Model, Dynamical models in continuous
and discrete time), Machine Learning and Fracture Mechanics.</p>
<p>I follow the master at the Dynamics and Control Research Group, that is mainly
active in nonlinear, multibody and network dynamics, robotics, nonlinear
control and acoustics (which most of my courses were about). The group&rsquo;s
research output always fascinated me, hence I choose to focus my Internship solely on the activities of the Dynamics and Control group,
specifically acoustics.</p>
<p>Average as of 31/05/2022: 8.3/10.</p>
